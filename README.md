== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please go ahead and read this FAQ to understand more about TheUX Slider philosophy.


= What is the TheUx Slider goal?

The TUS (TheUx Slider) goal is to be the main slider of your website and not jack of 
all trades slider. 


= Why doesn't TUS have a settings page?

TUS was designed with the Single Responsibility Principle in mind. And for that, you 
don't need that many options. All the options you need you to SET UP the slider you
pass on shortcode. The options used on the SLIDES are defined when you add or edit them.


= But if I need more sliders, will I need to install a second slider pluing for that? =

This answer will sound a bit weird, but stay with me. 

Really? Do you really need to have more than one slider per website? Yes, I wrote website and not 
page. Please don't make that mistake. By nature, most of sliders sucks [Sliders Suck](http://krogsgard.com/2013/sliders-suck)

= WTF??? =

Let me put this way. Sliders are fancy animations that most of the time are there just a distract the 
user, and not to make any real convertion. As any UI element on your website, the slider must have a 
reason to exist. Putting it there just for esthetic purpose may hurt your website convertion and distracting
the visitors for complete your goals. The rule of thumb is: if the slider is part of your website strategie
and its serve a specific goal, no worries. Go for it! Otherwise, I strongly suggest you to rethink its use. 

= Ok, I'm sold. Just out of curiosity, why did you write this plugin then? =

Come on..it's fun. Don't agree? 

1. Learning is my main reason. TheUx Slider is real plugin. It has OOP, PHP, JS, WP plugins development..and so on.
All the things you need to improve your skills. 

1. I want people to be aware about the this slider fever. It's unbelievable that people are paying for 'premium' sliders.
Not only that, it's a common practice for 'premium themes' to include two, three or even four different sliders. I don't 
know if it's only me, but that is nonsense.
